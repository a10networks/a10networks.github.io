## Coding issues

### 1.Coding Style

This project code are following `Prettier` coding style. Developers do not need to care of coding style consistency as long as using `VSCode` editor and installed `Prettier` plugin. `VScode` will format your code automatically through Prettier when saving file due to `.vscode/settings.json`.

```typescript
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```
