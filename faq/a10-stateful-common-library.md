# A10 GUI Common Library

## Why do I need this library?

To have the consistent look and feel cross multiple product line such as Harmony Controller, Thunder, and development teams. 

Auto-generate React GUI form pages using UI JSON schema files provided by the CM team. CM uses CM schema files to generate UI JSON schema files.

## Setup Issues

### How to install?

1. Add a10-gui-common to your package.json.

```

2. Execute `npm i a10-gui-common`

 `$ npm i a10-gui-common`
