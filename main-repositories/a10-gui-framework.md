# A10 GUI Framework

## Introduction

A10 GUI Framework is based on modern web design. At the heart of it, we leverage a component based front-end JavaScript framework called React.jsi. Together with Reduxii and our proposals embodied in a set of design patterns, we believe this will go a long way to providing a set of tools to build appealing, modern, and consistent web UI with relative ease and simplicity.
